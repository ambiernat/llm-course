Introduction to Python – Machine Learning Bookcamp
You can follow this English course from the OpenClassrooms e-learning platform, which is free and covers the python basics for data analysis: Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis - OpenClassrooms . It is important to know some basics such as: how to run a Jupyter notebook, how to import libraries (and what libraries are), how to declare a variable (and what variables are) and some important operations regarding data analysis.
