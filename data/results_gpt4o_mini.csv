If you don’t, read the article and join the coursIntroduction to Pythone too :)
Introduction to Python – Machine Learning Bookcamp
You can follow this English course from the OpenClassrooms e-learning platform, which is free and covers the python basics for data analysis: Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis - OpenClassrooms . It is important to know some basics such as: how to run a Jupyter notebook, how to import libraries (and what libraries are), how to declare a variable (and what variables are) and some important operations regarding data analysis.

"To configure GPU support for TensorFlow on your Ubuntu machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Nvidia Drivers**: Download and install the appropriate Nvidia drivers from [Nvidia's website](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx).

2. **Install CUDA Toolkit**: You need the CUDA toolkit. You can install it from [Nvidia's CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive). Make sure to select a version compatible with your TensorFlow installation, such as CUDA 11.x.

3. **Install cuDNN**: Download and install cuDNN from [Nvidia's cuDNN download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download).

4. **Set Up TensorFlow**: You can install TensorFlow with GPU support by following the installation instructions on TensorFlow's official site. For Linux, refer to the relevant section in the [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux_1). 

5. **Configure Environment Variables**: If needed, you may need to set environment variables related to CUDA as pointed out in some guides, such as using `echo` commands to create environment scripts.
