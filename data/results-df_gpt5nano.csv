"Based on the FAQ:

- The course has an original GitHub repository (the original course repo).
- You can create your own GitHub repository for the course (notes, homework, projects, etc.).
- You should fork the original course repo and add a link to your notes in your own repo under the Community Notes section, then create a pull request to sync with the original repo.
- For grading, you must provide the URL to your repository (the one containing your submission).

The FAQ does not mention a separate “sign-up link” repository.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

"Based on the FAQ, questions and answers are organized in a simple, sectioned Q&A format:

- Sections/categories are used (e.g., General course-related questions, Miscellaneous).
- Each entry has:
  - Question: the exact user-facing question.
  - Answer: a concise response, sometimes with steps, links, or attribution.

Examples of the structure you can mirror:
- Section: General course-related questions
  - Question: How long is the course?
  - Answer: Approximately 4 months, but may take more if you want to do some extra activities (an extra project, an article, etc)

- Section: General course-related questions
  - Question: I just joined. What should I do next? How can I access course materials?
  - Answer: Welcome to the course! Go to the course page (http://mlzoomcamp.com/), scroll down and start going through the course materials. Then read everything in the cohort folder for your cohort’s year. Click on the links and start watching the videos. Also watch office hours from previous cohorts. Go to DTC YouTube channel and click on Playlists and search for {course yyyy}. ML Zoomcamp was first launched in 2021. Or you can just use this link: http://mlzoomcamp.com/#syllabus

- Section: Miscellaneous
  - Question: Do you pass a project based on the average of everyone else’s scores or based on the total score you earn?
  - Answer: Alexey Grigorev: “It’s based on all the scores to make sure most of you pass.”

How you can structure your own questions and answers similarly:
- Put the question under a relevant section.
- Keep the answer concise and provide concrete details, steps, or links when helpful.
- If an answer is attributed, include the attribution (e.g., name) as shown.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

You can follow this English course from the OpenClassrooms e-learning platform, which is free and covers the python basics for data analysis: Learn Python Basics for Data Analysis - OpenClassrooms .

(Mélanie Fouesnard)",14890cd2,Where can I learn the necessary Python knowledge for this course?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"- Your midterm project will be reviewed by peers who cross-check that the training process works on someone else’s system, using a Python file (train.py) that should be included in the environment. Knowing how to run a notebook helps you develop and verify that code before sharing it.
- In real life, training is typically done by running a Python script rather than a notebook, so being able to run and test notebooks is part of preparing a runnable, shareable workflow.
- There can be environment issues when launching notebooks; for example, an ImportError related to jinja2 can occur, and a fix is to upgrade nbconvert. Being able to run notebooks lets you troubleshoot these kinds of problems.
- Practical tips from the material also note simple workarounds in notebook commands (e.g., on Windows, use !dir instead of !ls) to ensure you can run and inspect outputs in the notebook.","Check this article.

"- You need CUDA and cuDNN to run TensorFlow with GPU on Ubuntu. Install Nvidia drivers first, then CUDA and cuDNN, and finally TensorFlow with GPU support.

What to do (based on the course materials):
- Install Nvidia drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
- Linux/TensorFlow installation path: Install TensorFlow with pip (Linux)
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux_1
  - Make sure to follow the guidance to install CUDA by environment (as indicated in the guide)
- Install CUDA toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive (choose an 11.x.x series as referenced)
- Install cuDNN: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
- Optional: follow the course-referenced simplified guide for Ubuntu setup: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/
- After completing these steps, you should be able to train/infer with GPU in TensorFlow.

Note (optional troubleshooting): If you encounter GPU memory allocation issues, you can try enabling memory growth in TensorFlow as described in the course notes:
- Configuring memory growth: set config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True in a TensorFlow session.",Here is an article that worked for me: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/,34b7fd35,How do I configure GPU support for TensorFlow on my Ubuntu machine?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"Yes. A resource that’s listed in the FAQ for installing TensorFlow with GPU on Ubuntu is:

- https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/

Additionally, the FAQ references a simplified guide for installing CUDA and cuDNN on Ubuntu 22.04 (which you’ll need to run TensorFlow with GPU).",Here is an article that worked for me: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/,34b7fd35,Can you direct me to a resource for installing TensorFlow with GPU on Ubuntu?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"Based on the CONTEXT, the procedure to set up TensorFlow with GPU on Ubuntu involves installing NVIDIA drivers and the CUDA/cuDNN stack, then installing TensorFlow for Linux. A linked article is also provided that allegedly worked for someone.

Steps (as described in the CONTEXT):
- Install NVIDIA drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
- On Linux/Ubuntu, install TensorFlow using the Linux path (pip): https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux_1
- Make sure to follow step 4 to install CUDA by environment (as referenced in the Linux install guide), including exporting XLA-related environment settings, e.g. an environment variable like XLA_FLAGS to point to the CUDA data directory in your environment.
- Install CUDA Toolkit version 11.x.x: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
- Install cuDNN: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
- After these installations, you should be able to train/infer with GPU in TensorFlow.
