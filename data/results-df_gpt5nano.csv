- You must provide the URL to your own repository (the one containing your homework) to receive a grade.
- The repository must be public so graders can access it.
- You may also create your own GitHub repository for the course (notes, homework, projects) and link to it from the original course repo’s Community Notes, then sync via a pull request.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

"- There can be issues when launching a Jupyter notebook in a fresh environment (for example, an ImportError related to jinja2). A common fix shown in the course is to switch to the main environment and run: pip install nbconvert --upgrade.

- For midterm projects, you also need to know how to run Python code outside the notebook: a train.py file is required so your peers can review and cross-check that the training works on their systems. It must be a Python file and should be included in the environment (conda or with pipenv). The course notes that running a Python script for training is usually how training jobs look in real life, which is why this matters.","Check this article.

- Article that worked for someone: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/

- Section 8: How to install CUDA & cuDNN on Ubuntu 22.04 (mentions you need to set up CUDA and cuDNN; refers to a simplified guide by Osman Ali)

- Miscellaneous: CUDA toolkit and cuDNN Install for Tensorflow (Linux/WSL) with steps and links, including NVIDIA drivers and CUDA/cuDNN installation:
  - NVIDIA drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
  - CUDA toolkit 11.x.x: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
  - cuDNN download: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download

"Here are the GPU setup steps for TensorFlow on Ubuntu, based on the course materials:

- You need CUDA and cuDNN to enable GPU support.
  - See the note that to run TensorFlow with GPU on your local machine you’ll need to set up CUDA and cuDNN (and a simplified guide exists for Ubuntu 22.04).

- Install Nvidia drivers for Ubuntu.
  - Driver source: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx

- Install CUDA and cuDNN (Linux/Ubuntu path).
  - Install CUDA toolkit (CUDA toolkit 11.x is referenced).
  - Install cuDNN (as linked in the resources).
  - The Linux path mentions following steps to install CUDA via environment configuration (follow the guidance in the linked resources).
  - One recommended approach is to install TensorFlow using Linux-friendly methods (see below) and then ensure CUDA is available to the environment.

- Install TensorFlow with GPU support (two options):
  - Option 1: Install via pip the TensorFlow way for Linux
    - Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux_1
  - Option 2: Use Anaconda and install the package tensorflow-gpu
    - Install via Anaconda prompt or environment, then install TensorFlow through the Anaconda package
  - After installing, you should be able to train/infer with GPU in TensorFlow.

- Optional environment setup notes:
  - There is a command referenced to set up CUDA-related environment variables (for example, a snippet involving XLA_FLAGS and conda activation scripts). Follow the documented steps to ensure your environment variables point to the CUDA/CuDNN locations in your conda environment.

- If you encounter memory allocation issues on the GPU:
  - You can enable memory growth at the start of your notebook/script:
    - config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
    - config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
    - session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)

- A practical reference that has worked for others:
  - Article: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/

In short: install Nvidia drivers, install CUDA toolkit and cuDNN, install TensorFlow with GPU support (via pip or Anaconda), configure CUDA environment variables as advised, and (if needed) enable GPU memory growth to avoid allocation errors.",Here is an article that worked for me: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/,34b7fd35,How do I configure GPU support for TensorFlow on my Ubuntu machine?,machine-learning-zoomcamp

"Here are the available paths in the FAQ for setting up TensorFlow with GPU on Ubuntu:

- A recommended article that many have used: https://knowmledge.com/2023/12/07/ml-zoomcamp-2023-project/

- For Ubuntu 22.04 (CUDA & cuDNN): TensorFlow with GPU requires CUDA and cuDNN. A simplified guide is available from the FAQ:
  - Install NVIDIA drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx
  - Install the CUDA toolkit (11.x.x): https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
  - Install cuDNN: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download
  - Then you should be able to train/infer with GPU in TensorFlow. For Linux/Ubuntu, follow the Linux pip path to install TensorFlow with GPU support: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#linux_1
  - When following the Linux path, make sure to follow step 4 to install CUDA by environment (as referenced in the FAQ).

In short: install NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit (11.x), and cuDNN, then install TensorFlow for Linux (pip) and verify GPU usage.
